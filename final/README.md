# General description about how CSS is applied to pages

- The rule set 'display: flex', 'justify-content: space-between' makes the element will be a flex container, horizontally arranging its children with space between them. Also, 'align-items' will be used to align to the left, or right, creating a typical navigation bar layout.

- Replace float property in CSS by using grid and flexbox, this refactoring creates a more responsive layout for the 'service' section in index.html. It ensures that the element are placed horizontally without using specific width & 'float: left'
